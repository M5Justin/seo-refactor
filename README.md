## Description
The goal of this project was to take a website that was already built using  
CSS and HTML code and refactor the code to acceptable criteria. During this  
process I learned how to fix a broken button, consolidate and organize in  
order to follow proper semantic structure, comment on refactors, write a  
proper README file, and correctly deploy to a live URL.
